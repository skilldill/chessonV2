      <h2>Friend invites without platform friction</h2>
      <p>
        Most friend games start from a message thread, not from a complex gaming lobby. A link-based flow matches this behavior directly: create the
        room, share the URL, and move to the board. That reduces failure points before move one. You do not need to explain account steps, ask your
        friend to search for your profile, or walk through additional menus. The invitation itself becomes the exact game entry point.
      </p>
      <p>
        This speed is valuable for both casual and improvement-oriented players. Casual players get immediate sessions with less coordination, while
        improving players can run repeatable game blocks and post-game reviews with the same partner. The less time you spend on setup, the more
        consistent your practice cadence becomes.

      <h2>Build a repeatable friend-match routine</h2>
      <p>
        A stable routine can stay very lightweight. Set a recurring time, send a fresh link, play one to three focused games, and review one key
        moment after each match. This structure keeps sessions short but useful. It also avoids link confusion because every new game has a clear,
        recent invite. Over several weeks, this small operational discipline improves consistency more than occasional long sessions.
